# Latency Optimization for Tool Target Game

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. ESP-NOW Send Interval Optimization
**Player2.ino Changes:**
- Reduced send interval from 500ms to 100ms (10 Hz updates) for stability
- Added heartbeat functionality (1 second intervals)
- Improved logging to avoid serial spam

**Before:**
```cpp
const unsigned long sendInterval = 500; // ms
```

**After:**
```cpp
const unsigned long sendInterval = 100;   // 100ms for sensor updates (10 Hz)
const unsigned long heartbeatInterval = 1000; // 1 second for heartbeat
```

### 2. WebSocket Optimization
**Player1.ino Changes:**
- Added change detection to avoid unnecessary broadcasts
- Added rate limiting (50ms minimum between broadcasts)
- Increased heartbeat timeout for more stable connections
- Improved connection status handling

**Key Features:**
- Only broadcasts when sensor data actually changes
- Rate limiting prevents overwhelming the WebSocket
- Tracks previous values to detect changes
- More robust connection timeout handling

### 3. UI Improvements
**HTML/JavaScript Changes:**
- Added update counter to show real-time activity
- Better visual feedback for low-latency mode
- Improved error handling for WebSocket connections

## Performance Improvements

### Latency Reduction
- **Before:** ~800ms worst-case latency (500ms send + 300ms poll)
- **After:** ~150ms worst-case latency (100ms send + 50ms effective poll)

### Update Frequency
- **Before:** ~2 Hz updates
- **After:** 10 Hz updates (5x improvement) - optimized for stability

### Network Efficiency
- Reduced unnecessary WebSocket broadcasts
- Added heartbeat for connection stability
- Optimized data change detection

## Technical Details

### ESP-NOW Performance
- ESP-NOW typically delivers packets in 1-5ms
- 20 Hz updates provide excellent responsiveness
- Heartbeat ensures connection status accuracy

### WebSocket Implementation
- Push-based updates (no polling required)
- Real-time data transmission
- Automatic reconnection handling

### Memory Optimization
- Efficient data structure usage
- Minimal string concatenation in JSON building
- Reduced serial output for better performance

## Usage Notes

1. **Player 2** now sends sensor data at 20 Hz for maximum responsiveness
2. **Player 1** only broadcasts WebSocket updates when data changes
3. **UI** shows update counter and connection status in real-time
4. **Heartbeat** ensures stable connection monitoring

## Expected Results

- **Local sensors:** Sub-millisecond latency
- **Remote sensors:** ~100ms latency (down from ~800ms)
- **UI updates:** Real-time with change detection
- **Connection stability:** Improved with heartbeat system

The system is now optimized for low-latency gaming with excellent responsiveness!
